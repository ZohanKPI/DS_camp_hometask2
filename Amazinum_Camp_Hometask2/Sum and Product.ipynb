    "# The solution:\n",
    "From the dialogue provided in the task we know that Prod does not know the numbers, because their product cannot be expressed with two prime numbers and it cannot be a product of two unique numbers, otherwise Prod would know the numbers. For example, number 12 cannot be a product of two unique numbers, since there are 2 number pairs satisfying the condition (2 and 6, 3 and 4), whereas number 10 can only be the multiplication result of 2 and 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sum knows it, which means that there are no two pairs that satisfy the condition that we have just established. For instance, if the sum is 7, it can have two possible number pairs (3 and 4, 2 and 5), and if we multiply those numbers we will get 12 and 10 respectively. Based on the previous example, 10 doesn't satisfy our condition, whereas 12 does. Simply said, ALL of the sum pairs should have non-unique products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step, Prod is able to guess that there's only one pair of numbers that satisfies the previous two conditions, therefore, he now knows the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, Sum now knows the numbers based on Prod's response, so there is only one pair of numbers that satisfies all the previous conditions. The numbers should also be the same numbers Prod guessed in the previous statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "With analytical solution out of the way, let's get to the code:"
